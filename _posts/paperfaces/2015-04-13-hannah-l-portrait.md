PaperFaces portrait of Hannah L. inspired by a [photograph on Sktchy](http://sktchy.com/7gqmFc).

Decided to give live streaming a try when I set out to draw this portrait. Wow, what a disaster.

First. Finding a way to record my hands drawing while simultaneously mirroring my iPad's screen proved to be quite the challenge. I don't have a dedicated video camera to do that, so I had to get creative if I wanted to display two video feeds during the live stream.

Decided to use the iPhone 5s's camera and mirror its screen to my iMac using Quicktime[^yosemite-capture] to capture all of the off camera stuff. And then use [**Reflector**](http://www.airsquirrels.com/reflector/) to mirror my iPad Air's screen over AirPlay and stitch everything together with [**Open Broadcaster Software**](https://obsproject.com/) transmitting the stream to YouTube.

[^yosemite-capture]: A new feature included in Mac OS X Yosemite, is the ability to [display capture an iOS device](http://9to5mac.com/2015/03/21/how-to-record-video-from-phone-to-mac/) using a Lightning cable.

### Bandwidth Woes

This setup worked out pretty well apart from me having to sit in a really awkward position for over an hour. But the real pain turned out to be my ISP and the weak internet plan I was on. 1Mbps upload speeds are garbage for live streaming unless you want to knock the output quality way down.

For [my first attempt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH2H9kHduRs) the stream was completely unwatchable and played more like a slideshow than a movie. Eventually I bumped up my plan to the next tier to double my upload bandwidth (which is still crazy slow), giving me a smooth and [hiccup free 480p stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaLAeb7Pc90).

### Paint Drying

While a fun learning experience it's probably more trouble than it's worth. I'm sure one or two people out there might find it helpful to watch how I draw with Paper by FiftyThree in real time, but personally I think it's super boring. Not to mention I couldn't sort out a way to record audio and actually provide commentary as I drew --- which is probably more useful than the actual drawing.

I suppose if the demand is there I might try this again some night when my wife isn't streaming Netflix. For now I think the sped up time lapse approach is the way to go.
