Similar to previously years, I started out with the best of intentions for **Inktober 2016**.

After taking a few days to complete a single ink wash --- I was spent. Working digitally has spoiled me to the point that sitting at a desk instead of the sofa, cleaning brushes, and dealing with messes is just too much work to bother with.

October is half over and I suppose there's still time for me to knock out another portrait or two. If past years are any indication there's not a good chance of that happening... :neutral_face:
