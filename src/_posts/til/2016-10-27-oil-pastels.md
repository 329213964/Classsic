Not to overstate the obvious here, but oil pastels do not behave like colored pencils.

Their size and shape should have been enough to clue me into that fact, but I proceeded to use them like a pencil anyways. Punished severely for this ignorance I was.

Made a slight recovery when I approached using the tool like oil paint. *Glob on specks of color, and let them mix with each other naturally.* They don't quite have the mixing quality of paint, but with a finger or blending stumps pigment can be pulled about.

Attempting to create form with precise strokes is totally not the way to approach oil pastels.
