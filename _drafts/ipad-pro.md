The single most exciting thing out of Apple's announcement that they're doing a stylus is how iOS will evolve to integrate with it. There's no question that **Apple's iPad Pro** has the makings of being the tablet of my dreams. My internal strife is around timing: "do I need it in November" or "can I wait for Pencil support to trickle down to the inevitable iPad Air 3".

{% include toc.html %}

Left to my wife it would be a firm *"uhh no, we're not spending close to $1,000 on a stupid iPad."* My decision tree is slightly more nuance than than hers {% include icon.html name="wink" %}. Convincing myself that an iPad Pro + Apple Pencil would be light years ahead of my current iPad Air 2 and set of styli[^styli].

[^styli]: Current styluses I use: Pencil by FiftyThree, Pogo Connect (for the nib alone since the original doesn't play nice with my iPad Air 2), and generics from Amazon.

## The Price to Play

If money were no object I'd drop the necessary coin to purchase said iPad Pro and Apple Pencil today (or whenever they officially release). But that's not the world I live in and if I want to be an early adopter there's an inherit cost.

Spending $99 on Apple's stylus is a *no brainer* for me --- $799 for an iPad with a larger screen, beefier processor, more RAM, and fancy internal speakers... not so much.

The new screen has a whole host of improvements and new technology that is needed to make the Apple Pencil the stylus of my dreams. It's the larger size and bulk that comes with it that do little to flutter my heart and open my wallet. Sure, I get it... if an Air 3 debuted alongside with comparable specs and support for the new stylus it Pro sales would probably be impacted.

So if the 12.9-inch screen isn't enough to sell me what else is there...

## Why the Tablet?

Using an iPad Air 2 for the last year I've never once thought *"sure would be great if this ran faster and the screen was larger."* The convenience and power of drawing on an iPad has been what's compelled me the most.

Apps like [**Paper by FiftyThree**](http://www.fiftythree.com/paper) sold me on the idea that pen and paper's digital counterparts could have a soul too. With Apple's new iPad Pro and Pencil stylus the missing gaps are quickly filling and expanding the possibilities of what these devices can create.

## That Apple Pencil Looks Magical

For awhile it seemed as if Apple wasn't too concerned with artists and hobbyists creating on the iPad as Microsoft was with the Surface. Sure there was that "[Start Something New](https://web.archive.org/web/20150127023142/http://www.apple.com/start-something-new/)" promotional campaign they ran showcasing work created with artistic apps, but nothing in the way of pushing the tools further than the competition.

That all hopefully changes in November when the Apple Pencil is available. Until I can get some hands time on with one I'm trying to absorb as much information on it that I can.

### Improved Accuracy

I've used a handful of styli in my time and one thing they've never been is accurate. In my **Palm Treo** days they were small and easy to lose. While on iPad they've faired better in their feel and usability but have been held back by iOS and the hardware running it. Everything was designed to be touched with finger tips rendering a fine point stylus useless unless it leverage some sort of voodoo via Bluetooth.

This quote from Apple's iPad Pro product page tells me they're serious about pushing the platform forward for artists:

<blockquote>
  <p>iPad Pro knows whether you’re using your finger or Apple Pencil. When iPad Pro senses Apple Pencil, the subsystem scans its signal at an astounding 240 times per second, giving it twice the data points it normally collects with your finger. This data, combined with Apple-designed software, means that there’s only milliseconds between the image you have in your mind and the one you see on the display.</p>

</blockquote>

### Position, Force, and Tilt

Pressure sensitive styli had played a big role in how I drew and painted on the iPad. If Paper by FiftyThree and the Air 2 supported the [Pogo Connect]({{ site.url }}{% post_url mastering-paper/2013-07-08-pogo-connect-smart-pen %}) I'd probably be still using it --- even though it wasn't designed well.

Coming from a background in the fine arts I learned how to manipulate graphite and paint by varying pressure. To some extent this was possible with the Pogo Connect (and others[^pressure-styli]) if you could adapt to the lack of precision and lag.

[^pressure-styli]: The following Bluetooth styli also pressure sensitive: [Wacom Intuos Creative Stylus 2](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MNGIGMS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00MNGIGMS&linkCode=as2&tag=mademist-20&linkId=3MSUXH5QRNRUSZBO), [Wacom Bamboo Stylus](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LZW7RS0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00LZW7RS0&linkCode=as2&tag=mademist-20&linkId=5NSEUCIDTRSDWORD), [Adobe Ink & Slide](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LNECVN6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00LNECVN6&linkCode=as2&tag=mademist-20&linkId=BYWPU37DS5KLIOVG), [Adonit Jot Touch](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KFAG64O/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00KFAG64O&linkCode=as2&tag=mademist-20&linkId=2MWTP7IBZA6S3V5Y)

To my knowledge FiftyThree's Pencil stylus was the first for iPad to factor in the angle at which it is held. By tilting it on your side strokes begin to vary from thick to thin with a feature named [**Surface Pressure**](https://vimeo.com/98146708). With Apple's stylus, tilt looks to go mainstream.
