Drawing the night sky, stars, galaxies, planets, and other celestial bodies is a ton of fun with the Paper iPad app by FiftyThree. Much like [drawing blue skies and clouds]({{ site.url }}{% post_url mastering-paper/2013-09-05-drawing-clouds %}), it is very hard to screw them up if you follow a few simple guidelines.

{% include toc.html %}

In this Paper by FiftyThree tutorial I'll take you through my process of painting an outer space scene using only my finger. In the second half of this guide I'll demonstrate how to paint another scene, but with FiftyThree's Pencil stylus instead. Taking advantage of Surface Pressure and [Blend]({{ site.url }}{% post_url mastering-paper/2013-11-20-pencil-first-look %}) the effects are easier and faster to pull off.

Oh and I'm trying something different with this guide. I've toyed around with short video tutorials before, but this time I'm including two that can stand on their own. Using footage captured directly from an iPad and another set recorded off screen to show my hands, I edited together the entire painting process from start to end. 

Each video is fully annotated with notes and tips throughout, so be sure to watch directly on [Youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/user/anotherjpeg/) since I'm not sure if they work on mobile or in the apps yet. Don't worry, for those of you who learn better with pictures and text I'm still including all that detail below --- just scroll past the videos that begin each section.

And with that let's get started.

## Painting outer space with your finger

</figure>

### Cover the canvas

Start by covering the canvas with a dark color. For this technique to work properly you need to fill it manually. The page fill "shortcut" has some limitations with how colors are applied to it that won't give the effect we need. To learn more about why that is check out my guide on [Paper's Color Picker]({{ site.url }}{% post_url mastering-paper/2014-12-18-color-picker %}).

<figure>

  <figcaption>The faster you move your fingers the larger the strokes, the quicker you can fill in the background with black.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Star clusters and flow

Use white or a tint to lighten the dark background and lay the ground work for the composition. Using a photographic reference helps, but you can free form it and just let it happen as you glide your finger across the canvas.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-space-lighten-bg-color.jpg" alt="screenshot of light blue color">
  <figcaption>Mixing up a bright blue tint to lighten the black background.</figcaption>
</figure>

To create smooth tones keep your finger on the screen and use a circular motion to blend out the edges. You're trying to avoid harsh edges as much as you can.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-space-lighten-bg.jpg" alt="lightening the background with a finger and white">

  <figcaption>For areas that are dense with stars apply multiple layers of white to brighten them up.</figcaption>
</figure>

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **ProTip:** Zoom-in to paint thinner strokes and fill smaller shapes.
{: .notice}

#### Blue glazes

Starting with a light blue glaze over the lighten areas to the left. You don't have to worry about being precise since it will only show on the white areas. Because we filled in the background with a black color earlier it is already at its darkest point and adding more color to it won't change that.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-space-blue-glaze-1.jpg" alt="screenshot of painting a blue glaze">
</figure>

Use the same technique as before with the white color. Keep your strokes controlled and smooth. If as you paint an area doesn't appear to smoothen out move your finger slower, and be sure not to lift it off the screen for more than a second. Doing so will indicate to Paper that a new stroke was made and you will see a visible seam between the values.

  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-space-blue-glaze-2.jpg" alt="screenshot of darkening blue with layered watercolor strokes">
  <figcaption>Building up the blues with layer upon layer of watercolor.</figcaption>
</figure>

To create the illusion of depth add more glaze layers towards the outsides of the shapes. This will leave pockets of lightness in the center where we will tap in stars later.

Feel free to adjust the darkness of the color by using the color slider. Don't go too far with it though. Multiple layers of a light color generally looks better than a single dark color layer.

#### Fuchsia glazes

Repeat the exact same process on the right half of the composition now, but with a fuchsia or violet hue. When you finish you should have something that vaguely resembles this.

<figure class="half">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-space-violet-glaze-1.jpg" alt="screenshot of mixing a fuchsia color">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-space-violet-glaze-3.jpg" alt="screenshot of finished fuchsia glazes">
</figure>

If you went too dark anywhere mix a tint of blue or fuchsia (depending on where you want to lighten) and dab your finger quickly to pull out some color. Use your best judgment and correct as needed. There may be some back and forth between the tint and a darker color to get the gradient just right.

</figure> 

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **ProTip:** Move quickly when using a watercolor brush loaded with white. Go too slow and it'll turn a pure white way too fast.
{: .notice}

### Placing stars with your fingers

Now begins the tedious process of placing stars one by one. I like to start with a medium to dark color that is in the family of the area I'm placing them. Starting on the blue side first we'll want to mix up a star color that is... bluish --- what a shocker! Using Paper's Color Picker makes things so much easier. Just sample a blue spot you painted earlier and then manipulate the sliders to get the intensity just right.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-space-blue-stars.jpg" alt="screenshot of blue star color">
  <figcaption>Mixing a medium dark blue to lay down some stars with.</figcaption>
</figure>

Try to use your fingertip with a controlled tapping motion. If you strike the screen and drag your finger at all, a small streak will appear instead of a dot. If this happens just use the two finger [Rewind gesture to undo](http://support.fiftythree.com/customer/portal/articles/892210-basic-features#undo) the mistake.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-space-blue-stars-finger.jpg" alt="using a fingertip to create stars">
</figure>

The more stars you add the greater the effect. It also helps to vary the size of the stars and bump up the brightness as you work. I strongly suggest using just the pencil tool and avoiding the rest. The pencil is semi-transparent and looks more natural than the ink pens.

Tapping in the same spot a few times is an affective way of brightening a star. Using your finger tip isn't that accurate so it can take a few Rewinds to get the placement just right.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-space-bright-star.jpg" alt="screenshot of zoomed pencil stars">
  <figcaption>Increase the size or brightness of a star by placing more dots closing to each other.</figcaption>
</figure>

As before when you move over to the fuchsia and violet half of the space scene, switch your star color to match. Glazes can be applied to darken patches of stars to add some more dimension as well The same goes for using white to lighten an area. There really is no right or wrong way to approach it, so feel free to experiment and find what works best for you.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-space-violet-star-glaze.jpg" alt="screenshot of stars glazed with violet watercolor">
  <figcaption>Stars that may have went too bright can be harmonized by painting a layer or two of watercolor matching the background.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Two worlds

Our space scene wouldn't be complete without a planet or two, so let's remedy that shall we?

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-space-planet-placement.jpg" alt="screenshot of planet placement">
</figure>

The hardest part to world building is deciding where to place the planet. Since I've kept the composition cut in half for the most part, it would seem to make the most sense if we place a planet on each side.

Mix up a white or tint and switch to the fountain pen tool. Then simply place your finger on the canvas where you'd like the planet to appear and hold it for a few seconds. The longer you hold the larger the dot that is made.

<figure class="half">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-space-mix-planet-color.jpg" alt="mixing a light color to create a planet with">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-space-dot-planet.jpg" alt="tap and hold with the fountain pen to create a large dot">
  <figcaption>After mixing a light color tap and hold with the fountain pen to create a large dot.</figcaption>
</figure>

I'm placing my planet off to the right in the violet portion of space so I'll want to mix up a similar hue. Using the watercolor brush, paint glazes over the white dot gradually moving further and further away from one of the edges. In this example I'm moving towards the left to leave a highlight on the right edge.

<figure class="third">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-space-f-planet-1.jpg" alt="screenshot of glazing a planet with violet watercolor">

  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-space-f-planet-3.jpg" alt="screenshot of glazing a planet with violet watercolor">
</figure>

Continue adding glazes until one side fades completely into the darkness of space. To speed up the process increase the darkness of the color you're painting with.

Once you're satisfied with the results repeat the process for as many other planets as you need.

## Drawing outer space with Pencil

Building on the same techniques used in the first half of this guide, I'm going to now show you how Pencil can be used to enhance and speed up the process. For the most part you follow the exact same steps with a few embellishments here and there to ratchet up the realism in the piece.

<figure>
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/pdSp4Y4GOQs" frameborder="0"> </iframe>
  <figcaption><i class="fa fa-video-camera"></i> How to draw and paint an outer space scene with Pencil and Paper by 53.</figcaption>
</figure>

If you haven't already paired Pencil with Paper do so now. I find it helpful to go into Pencil's settings and turn off Blend[^blend-off] until I need it later. Avoids any unwanted smudges from appearing if you happen when not applying enough pressure with Pencil's tip.

[^blend-off]: To turn off the Blend feature tap the icon in the upper right corner of Paper when in journal view. Then tap Pencil > Finger and change the default behavior from Blend to **Nothing**.

### Covering the canvas part 2

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-space-2-bg-fill-pencil.jpg" alt="using Pencil to fill in a blank canvas">
</figure>

Just like with the first outer space scene I painted with must my finger you will want to cover the canvas in a dark color using fountain pen or marker tools. By using the wide side of Pencil's tip you can cover the screen much faster. The rubber on the side doesn't tear as quickly so anytime you have the opportunity to draw with it versus the tip --- take it.

### Building a background and star clusters part 2

I'm going to speed through these next steps since they're exactly the same as before. The only difference being they will be done with the Pencil stylus instead of your finger.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-space-2-bg-lighten.jpg" alt="lightening the black background with white and Pencil">
  <figcaption>Lighten the black using the watercolor brush and a white or tint.</figcaption>

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **ProTip:** Hold Pencil on its edge to move more quickly and organically through the composition.

  <figcaption>Add more layers of white to brighten an area. The centers of the shapes are a good place for these highlights.</figcaption>
</figure>

After you've lightened the background and are happy with the shapes created decide on what color or colors you want the background to be. For this scene I think a rainbow-ish gradient with colors from most of the light spectrum might look cool.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-space-2-light-blue-glaze.jpg" alt="screenshot of light blue glaze">
  <figcaption>Starting with a light blue, apply layer of glaze upon glaze to create smooth transitions of light to dark.</figcaption>
</figure>

Remember to take your time with the watercolor brush and don't be tempted to use too dark of a color. This isn't a race!

### Dropping in a planet

I've decided to place a medium sized planet towards the upper left corner. You could use the tap and hold trick to create a perfect circle like we did in the first painting, but I want something larger this time.

Since it's pretty difficult to draw a perfect circle freehand I'm going to use an object to trace around. I just so happen to have part of a rotary cutter that has a nice grip on it, so that's what I'm using. The cylindric box that Pencil ships in is a good alternative if you don't have anything else.

<figure class="half">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-space-2-circle-trace.jpg" alt="tracing around a rotary cutter with Pencil stylus">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-space-2-circle.jpg" alt="screenshot of a circle outline">
</figure>

Placing the object directly on the iPad's screen, carefully trace around its edge. It may be hard to match up the lines exactly on your first go so just Rewind to undo until you get it right.

With the outline done fill it in with the watercolor brush and a white (or tint). It's ok if your strokes bleed outside of the lines some it adds to the glowing effect we're trying to accomplish. Plus we're going to lightly Blend the edges later anyways so any mistakes will be down played.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-space-2-filled-circle.jpg" alt="screenshot of filled circle">
</figure>

After the planet's base coat has been applied decide on what color you want it to be and begin painting. For my scene I choose to paint with a dull looking red, being careful to stay within the lines as not to distort the circle's shape too much.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-space-2-planet-color.jpg" alt="screenshot of painting a planet">
  <figcaption>Build up layers of color to create a smooth gradation around the planets surface.</figcaption>
</figure>

Using the same process as before, leave one of the planet's edges exposed as you darken it. This will make it appear more three-dimensional as the tones are built up from light to dark.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-space-2-planet-shadow.jpg" alt="screenshot of painting a dark shadow across a planet">
</figure>

I started to lose the shape of the circle because I was painting pretty fast. To correct it I darkened the lower left corner until it merges with the rest of the scene. Depending on what color background is behind the planet this may be harder to cover-up.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **ProTip:** To help stay in the lines a stencil can be used. Simply hold it steady on the iPad's screen as you paint glazes with Pencil inside of it.
{: .notice}

#### Refining a planet

After you finish filling in the planet, now is a good time to go back in Pencil's settings and turn Blend[^blend-off] back on (if you previously turned it off like I did).

<figure class="half">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-space-2-planet-blend-1.jpg" alt="blending the planet's edge with a finger">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-space-2-planet-blend-2.jpg" alt="screenshot of a planet with the edges smudged">
</figure>

Using your finger tip, make quick swipes along the planet's edge. Be sure to follow it's shape with arc like motions. This will blur strokes and colors at the edge while retaining the circles shape. With the right amount of speed you should end up with a something that resembles a glowing orb.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-space-2-planet-lightening.jpg" alt="screenshot of lightening a planet with white watercolor">
</figure>

To correct a distorted shape that occurs from smudging too much, simple brush in bursts of whites and darks in the problem areas. Followed by more blending until you achieve a more pleasing shape. Try to think of the colors on screen as pixels of sand that you are pushing around with your finger tips.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-space-2-planet-edge.jpg" alt="screenshot of penciling in highlights">
</figure>

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **ProTip:** Finely sketched pencil strokes along the edges can also be effective at restoration work.
{: .notice}

#### Detailing a planet

Because this planet is larger than the first set I painted, there's room to sketch in craters and other textures. Use the Color Picker to sample the planet and mix up a lighter variation of it. With the pencil tool sketch in craters and holes. By flipping Pencil on its side you can use Surface Pressure to make charcoal like strokes that add a nice texture.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-space-2-planet-details.jpg" alt="screenshot of planet details drawn with pencil">
</figure>

I didn't spend too much time detailing my planet, but that's not to say you shouldn't. Building off of the techniques used in my other guides, painting glazes on top of the [penciled textures]({{ site.url }}{% post_url mastering-paper/2013-11-25-drawing-textures %}) will further enhance the realism.

### Tapping stars with Pencil

You guessed it, time to tap in a ton of stars again. Using a stylus like Pencil instead of your finger makes it much easier to accurately place hundreds of stars.

<figure class="half">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-space-2-stars-pencil.jpg" alt="tapping Pencil to create dots that look like stars">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-space-2-stars-pencil-2.jpg" alt="screenshot of blue stars drawn with Pencil">
  <figcaption>This first pass of stars is hard to see but that's ok. As you add more gradually increase their brightness.</figcaption>
</figure>

Just like before use a color that is in the family of the one you're placing the stars on. Start with a medium tone first and cover the canvas in stars before gradually using a lighter one. Save those bright stars for areas towards the middle of a galaxy or cluster --- it will look more natural that way.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-space-2-blue-stars-detail.jpg" alt="detail screenshot of blue stars drawn with Pencil">
  <figcaption>Detail of stars that have been slightly glazed with blue watercolor.</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Star variations

Size and brightness variation techniques used earlier are still fair game. If you're using Pencil and have Blend still enabled, there's a new trick available to you.

You may remember in the first part of this guide where I mentioned that stars made with the pen tools are too overpowering and bright. Well if you smudge them quickly with Blend they turn into small glowing orbs. It's a great effect that can add more variety to the composition.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-space-2-blended-stars.jpg" alt="screenshot of blended stars">
  <figcaption>Swipping your finger quickly over a large white star will create a glow star. You can even make trails by pulling your strokes slowly and smearing the star.</figcaption>
</figure>

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **ProTip:** If you don't have Pencil glowing orbs can be created with your finger by quickly dabbing white watercolor over a star.
{: .notice}

Just like earlier, star clusters can be lightened or darkened by glazing over them with the appropriate colors. If you do decide to lighten sections be sure to move fast as you paint to risk going too white.

## Two more things

There's two other techniques I wanted to share that didn't really have a place in the drawings above so I'm putting them here. These both require you to have FiftyThree's Pencil stylus and Blend feature enabled.

If you place strokes of light colors on top of a dark background and then slowly smudge upwards, an effect that mimics the aurora borealis can be achieved.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-space-aurora-blend.jpg" alt="a blended aurora in space">
  <figcaption>Direction and speed really matter here. The slower you move the further the color can be "pulled."</figcaption>
</figure>

A slightly modified approach to this technique can be used to create black holes. Instead of using slow upward smudges, you move in a circular pattern.

<figure class="third">
  <a href="{{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-space-blackhole-1-lg.jpg"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-space-blackhole-1-600.jpg" alt="screenshot of drawing a black hole step 1"></a>

  <figcaption>Obviously further refinement and the addition of stars needs to happen, but for five minutes of blend work it's not bad.</figcaption>
</figure>

Well I guess that's about it. Since doing video tutorials is fairly new for me (and super time intensive) let me know what works and what doesn't so I know if I should even bother. The best way you can do that is by liking them, subscribing to my YouTube channel, and leaving comments. Thanks!
