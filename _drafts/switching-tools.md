New to Paper by FiftyThree and just can't seem to figure out how to switch tools? I have the short answer for you right here.

The two white dots are you clue for solving this mystery.

Simply swipe across the row of tools to reveal another set of five ([Fountain Pen][fountain-pen], [Pencil][pencil], [Marker][marker], [Fine Tip Ink Pen][ink-pen], and [Watercolor Brush][watercolor-brush]) to the right.

I know what you're thinking, "wow how could anyone miss this?" Well from the amount of emails I receive a month asking how to change tools... quite a lot {% icon wink %}. It doesn't help that new installs default to the Think Kit tools, when it probably should be the other way around... but I digress.

Baffled by how to do something else in Paper? Leave a comment below, or if you'd prefer to keep it private fire off a message to me from my [Contact page]({{ site.url }}/contact/).
