Intro.

## Universal Paper App

Yes, you've read correctly --- Paper is now a universal iOS app that works on both iPad and iPhone. Every time I open Paper on my iPhone 5s I'm amazed all of the features found on the iPad version made the journey over. Much like the 1.6.1 update for iOS 7 I got the sense every bit of the app was touched by the team at FiftyThree. Even if that meant modifying a few of Paper's defining characteristics[^changes] for the better.

[^changes]: Yes gone are the journal book view and zoom loupe. Change is good, deal with it <svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="#icon-deal-with-it"></use></svg>.

## Importing Images

Love it or hate it (stick me in the love it camp), you can finally import images into Paper by FiftyThree! Tap the camera icon and you can either snap a picture or choose one from your photo library.

Currently you are limited to one photo per idea --- but you can scale it, rotate it, and even call-out an area of interest with a new *Spotlight option*.

I'm excited to use this feature as a sketching aid, drawing directly on reference images I've imported into Paper. There's no way to toggle this layer off yet (*psst... FiftyThree engineers if you're reading*), but it's easy enough to remove it leaving behing just what you've drawn or painted.

## Rotating Ideas

What a time saver this one is. Gone are the days of having to export an idea to your camera roll just to rotate it and share "right side up" on via email, Twitter, Tumblr, etc. Previously you had to export the idea to your camera roll, rotate it there, and then share to your networks or via email. And forget doing any of that with drawings you shared on Mix --- you just had to live with them always being horizontal.

Now there's a button conveniently located below each idea that lets you rotate in 90 degree intervals. And because of the new grid view they horizontal and vertical ideas live in harmony and look great next to each other. Which leads me to my next favorite feature found in Paper 3.0...

## Journals Replaced with "Spaces"

Paging through Paper's digital journals might have been a good idea years ago, but with idea counts in the hundreds it quickly becomes unusable. Journals transitioning into "Spaces" is one of the best things to happen to Paper since **Think Kit**.

Instead of ideas bound together in books you're presented with a different UI metaphor --- stacks of paper. These stacks expand into a neatly aligned grid of objects you can interact with when tapped on. I'll tell you this much, scrolling through ideas in this way sure beats flipping back 500+ pages to find a drawing I worked on a year ago.

These new "Spaces" are way more accommodating of the new content types found in Paper 3.0 as well. Ideas in portrait or landscape orientation fit in perfectly with notes and images. There's no way any of this would be usable or look half as good as it does now if FiftyThree stuck with the journal motif.

## Other New Additions

So those were the major features in 3.0 that will have the biggest impact on how I work with Paper. In my short time with the new iPad and iPhone versions here's a couple of other refinements I've come across. Feel free to add yours in the comments below.

### Many Hidden Gestures Have Dedicated Buttons Now

The various gestures in Paper are great time savers once you've learned them. For the most part they're natural and easily discoverable, but there's still some mystery to them --- especially if you're the type who skipped all of the tutorials and videos FiftyThree baked into the app to teach you them <svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="#icon-wink"></use></svg>

With 3.0 many of these gestures have been replaced with buttons in the UI.

Rewind Undo can be triggered with a gesture or by tapping the << icon in the tool tray.

The "* * *" button below each idea allows you to duplicate, delete, and move pages now. You no longer have to tap and hold and do finger gymnastics to copy a page and stick it in another set of ideas.

### Ability to Annotate Ideas and Create Text Notes

Perfect for to-do lists, recipes, or just adding captions to your ideas and photos. I could see this coming in handy for Mixers as a way of communicating between shares.

Basic formatting of text can be achieved by swiping across text to cycle through styles (Title, Subtitle, Bullet, and Sub-Bullet). You can also **bold**, *italize*, and <s>strikethrough</s> text by selecting it and tapping the right arrow followed by Style.

#### Changing the Default Idea Type

You can easily switch between idea types (Canvas/Photo/Text) by tapping their corresponding icons in the tool tray. But you can also change which type is the default when creating a new idea.

Just tap and hold on the new idea button at the bottom of the screen to switch.

### Integrated Mix

Mix is no longer something you "pull down" to access from within Paper. The stream of ideas from the people you follow on Mix (or should I say PAPER?) now appears inline with your private spaces.

On a sidenote, who has an extra $900 laying around they want to send my way so I can get me an **iPad Pro** and Apple Pencil? <svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="#icon-wink"></use></svg>
