#### [FiftyThree Pencil Review](({{ site.url }}{% post_url mastering-paper/2014-11-28-pencil-53-review %}))
Apart from the addition of Surface Pressure, little has changed with Pencil since I [first paired it to Paper]({{ site.url }}{% post_url mastering-paper/2014-11-28-pencil-53-review %}) over a year ago. It still feels great to use, still has an insane battery life, still enables the blend tool, and still lets you rest your wrists on the screen without messing up your drawing.

## What makes Pencil so unique and special?

FiftyThree's Pencil is not like other styli and pens designed for Apple's iPad tablet. The unique shape and meticulous crafted finishes (Walnut, Graphite, and Gold) are the obvious differences, but I think it's the unseen qualities of the instrument that truly sets it apart.

For starters Pencil allows you to switch between tools in an intuitive and natural way when working with Paper and apps that support FiftyThree's SDK[^SDK]. Bounce between drawing, erasing, and blending without ever having to tap select a new tool --- the tip draws, the eraser erases, and your finger smudges.

[^SDK]: List iOS apps that work with Pencil.

</figure>

From day one Paper's tools have had a level of expressiveness I've yet to see matched in other iPad apps. Pencil augments them all with improved accuracy, finer controls over the strokes you make and erase, and palm rejection so you can rest your wrists on the screen.

### A different kind of tip

Pencil's wedge shaped tip is covered in a rubbery material like so many other iPad styli, but unlike these "dumb" capacitive relatives, Pencil's is much smarter. Using a combination of hardware + software wizardry, your strokes become more expressive depending on how you move, align, and touch the tip to the iPad's screen.

Thin lines are made with the tip's point with wider ones made with the full side of the tip. No other stylus I know of has this ability, making Pencil feel less like a digital tool and more like a real piece of charcoal or graphite (without the mess of course). Oh, and the [tip is user replaceable](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MM4KD4U/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00MM4KD4U&linkCode=as2&tag=mademist-20&linkId=SIDCNA73WKOEKRHM) too.

### A built-in eraser

What would a pencil be without an eraser? Well FiftyThree's Pencil has one of those too. When you want to erase something you just flip Pencil on its head and glide the rubbery top over the mistake.

Size can be controlled by making contact with the eraser's corner (for small mistakes) or the entire width to remove a larger area. Just like the tip the eraser is replaceable, though I've never had a need to replace mine yet.

<div class="notice-info" markdown="1">
#### Learn Erasing and Undoing Techniques
If you're looking for other erasing techniques that don't rely on Pencil's eraser you're in luck. I wrote an entire guide dedicated to [correcting and covering-up mistakes]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /mastering-paper/2014-10-25-erasing %}).
</div>

## Setting up Pencil

There's not to getting started with Pencil. Upon opening the box and removing the plastic wrap you'll want to pinch the tip and pull to charge the battery. In about 90 minutes you'll be good to connect it with Paper (or one the many supported apps) by pressing the tip to the pairing spot.

To view more details about your Pencil (battery level, firmware, serial number) tap the FiftyThree logo (or your profile icon when signed into Mix) in the upper right corner. 

<figure>

  <figcaption>Screenshot of Pencil's settings in Paper app.</figcaption>
</figure>

<div class="notice-info" markdown="1">
#### Blend, Draw, Nothing Setting
You also have the option to toggle whether your finger **Blends**, **Draws**, or does **Nothing** when Pencil is connected to Paper. If you find Paper mistakenly smudging switching to Nothing mode is a great way to prevent that.
</div>

For even more information on how to setup your Pencil, change tips, or maintenance like updating the firmware I suggest you check our [FiftyThree's Support pages](http://support.fiftythree.com/customer/portal/topics/589142-pencil/articles). It's where I learned about this little fix after I noticed some erratic behavior in the app.

> If you have Multitasking Gestures or Accessibility Zoom enabled, this will prevent Pencil from operating effectively. Turn off Multitasking Gestures in your iPad Settings, under **General**. Turn off **Accessibility Zoom** under *General / Accessibility*.

## Surface Pressure, what's that?

When Pencil is connected to Paper it gains enhanced control and expressiveness over the tools and with a feature FiftyThree calls **Surface Pressure**. Stroke sizes are directly related to how much or how little of the tip's surface touches the screen. This applies to both the drawing end and eraser.

<div class="notice-warning" markdown="1">
#### Surface Area
Don't let **pressure** in the name fool you, it has very little affect over the marks you make. Pressing harder on the tip might have a slight effect due to the rubber deforming in shape, that's not really how Surface Pressure is meant to work.
</div>

Here's a cheat sheet I made showing how each of the tools respond to Surface Pressure.

<figure class="half">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="Surface Pressure cheat sheet">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="drawing with the tip, drawing with the edge">
  <figcaption>Marks made with and without zooming in to show the range of Surface Pressure enhanced tools. In most cases all of the tools can now make marks thinner/wider than possible without a connected Pencil stylus.</figcaption>
</figure>

If you ask me, the marriage of hardware and software that makes up Surface Pressure is Pencil's killer feature. It has completely transformed how I interact with Paper on my iPad by allowing me to be more free and loose. What does that mean exactly? Well let me show you...

### Pencil's design invites you to hold it differently

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="video showing alternate ways to hold Pencil">
  <figcaption>Surface Pressure let's you hold in alternate ways.</figcaption>
</figure>

I like to hold Pencil as if it's a piece of charcoal and utilize it's long edge when sketching. Not only does this change the quality of pencil strokes (I'll get to that in a minute), but it also causes you to use your entire arm instead of your wrist.

Sketching in this way is not only more fun but practicable. By using your entire arm you'll find that: 
  
  1. Drawing straight lines and ovals is much easier.
  2. You can create sensitive lines[^sensitive-lines] at will.
  3. Your drawings will have more movement and energy to them.
  4. It is quicker to fill in a large area.

[^sensitive-lines]: The shifting quality of weight, value, and texture of a line as related to a light source, spatial position, and weight or grounding of an object.

### A new tool for shading

You may have noticed in the cheat sheet above (or in your own experiments), that the sketch tool takes on new qualities with Surface Pressure. With this tool selected, the edge of Pencil's tip will make wide textured strokes that resembles those made with charcoal or graphite.

<figure class="half">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="wide sketch strokes with Pencil">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="strokes made with charoal and paper">
  <figcaption>Strokes made using the side of Pencil's tip compared against compressed charcoal and newsprint.</figcaption>
</figure>

Wide strokes made with the pencil tool overlap differently than the ink, marker, and brush tools. These "shade" strokes have a more defined edge can can cause color banding[^banding] in tones if not smoothed out. To better illustrate what I mean here's what I consider a tone with "blocky" strokes.

[^banding]: Abrupt changes between shades of the same color.

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="animation showing overlapping pencil strokes">
  <figcaption>With every overlapping pass the tones darken with noticeable edges of the stroke.</figcaption>
</figure>

<div class="notice-info" markdown="1">
#### ProTip: Shade in Circles
Reduce color banding by holding Pencil on its side and moving in a circular motion.
</div>

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="animation showing circular shading">
  <figcaption>Spread tones more evenly by overlapping them in a circular motion.</figcaption>
</figure>

If you look closely at the wide strokes of the pencil (sketch) tool, you'll notice it fades from dark to light.

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="closeup of Surface Pressure pencil stroke">
  <figcaption>Closeup of a pencil stroke. Dark edge is on the left and progressively gets lighter to the right.</figcaption>
</figure>

In my tests the placement it seems as if the placement of the darker edge is determined by the angle of your stroke. Dark points up and light points down. I've yet to find a way to reverse that, so it's worth keeping that fact in the back of your mind when making horizontal strokes.

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="show shade strokes and placement of dark and light">
  <figcaption>Dark points up, light points down.</figcaption>
</figure>

### What's Surface Pressure good for?

Now that you know what Surface Pressure is and roughly how it works. I thought it would be useful to show off what you can do with it.

#### Gesture drawing and other warm-ups

A great way to warm-up before doing any sort of serious drawing is with some quick gesture sketches. In art school we'd start each class capturing a model's movement with charcoal or conté crayons as they cycled through 2 minute poses.

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="charcoal on newsprint gesture drawings">
  <figcaption>Examples of gesture drawings in charcoal on newsprint paper.</figcaption>
</figure>

What's great about Pencil and Surface Pressure is you can pretty much get the same result as a stick of charcoal on newsprint paper. Even better is you're left with none of the mess on your fingers and hands.

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="Surface Pressure gesture drawings">
  <figcaption>Examples of gesture drawings in Paper with Pencil and Surface Pressure.</figcaption>
</figure>

To get the most out of this technique you're going to want to hold Pencil differently than you're accustomed to. Instead of using the one of the many [tripod grips](http://www.otplan.com/articles/pencil-grasp-patterns.aspx) you'll want to wrap your fingers around Pencil and rest your thumb just below the tip.

<figure class="half">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="traditional writing grip">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="palm grip">
  <figcaption>Comparison of grip types.</figcaption>
</figure>

As you sketch and draw with what I call the *palm grip* you'll need to get comfortable with both **pushing** and **pulling** your strokes. Your entire arm and wrist should be moving as you draw --- if you're only using just your wrist it won't be as effective. To better illustrate what I mean here's a slow-motion video of me drawing with the palm grip.

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="slow motion video of gesture drawing">
  <figcaption>Gesture drawing using Pencil held in the palm grip.</figcaption>
</figure>

Another great way to loosen up your arm and hand is to draw ovals over and over again. Focus on moving your entire wrist in loose circular motions and try to avoid stiff wrist movements. 

<figure class="half">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="animated GIF of circle drawing">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="shape drawing practice sheet">
  <figcaption>If you take a close look you'll notice I make several practice strokes in the air above the screen before making contact with the tip. This helps nail accurate and crisp lines without having to constantly erase or Rewind bad contours.</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Shading and tone building

Much of the same layering principles used when glazing with the watercolor brush can be applied to Surface Pressure armed pencil. If you're new to Paper and missed those techniques are need a brush up, I demonstrate them in [Mastering Paper: Back to Basics]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /mastering-paper/2014-02-09-basics %}#watercolor-brush-techniques).

Surface Pressure enabled shading does most of the hard work by automatically leaving marks that fade into the canvas. If you've had trouble painting smoothly with the watercolor brush or softening the edges, give the pencil tool a try --- it's way more forgiving.

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="zoomed in shading">
  <figcaption>Gesture drawing using Pencil held in the palm grip.</figcaption>
</figure>

Remember, each pass with the side of Pencil's tip leaves a noticeable stroke edge --- use this to your advantage! By being deliberate in the direction of your strokes you will help define and reinforce the form of an object. Sort of like [how hatching works]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /mastering-paper/2014-02-09-basics %}#ink-techniques), but with fatter strokes.

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="video of face shading with Pencil">
  <figcaption>By curving my strokes to match the dips around the nose it helps the form appear more three-dimensional.</figcaption>
</figure>

<div class="notice-info" markdown="1">
#### ProTip: Zoom In
For even more granularity over how fast a shade darkens, zoom in! You can get a few more levels of variation with each stroke to help make a more nuanced gradation.

#### Creating atmospheric effects

Creating atmospheric effects like fog, smoke, rays of light. Draw some sketches then write quick how-to.

## Blend, the Smudge Tool

As you might have guessed from the above heading, Blend lets you smudge stuff. Sadly this feature is only available to Paper when Pencil is connected, so you'll want to [pick one up](http://www.fiftythree.com/pencil "Buy Pencil by FiftyThree"). Trust me it's totally worth it!

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="finger blending stuff in Paper">
  <figcaption>Pushing pixels with your finger feels fantastic.</figcaption>
</figure>

### How does Blending work in Paper?

It's not a tool you select like the others, triggering it is way more intuitive than that. You simply use your finger to smudge whatever it is you want to blend or blur. And like most of Paper's tools it [reacts to the speed](http://making.fiftythree.com/the-precision-behind-blend/ "The Precision Behind Blend") at which you move.

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="video showing various types of blends">
  <figcaption>Speed matters. Fast strokes slightly blur objects while slow ones can be used to smudge and deform them.</figcaption>
</figure>

<div class="notice-info" markdown="1">
#### ProTip: Blending with a Non-Pencil Stylus
If you're looking for more control over your blends and smudges, try a capacitive stylus instead of your finger. As long as the tip of your stylus is big enough and Pencil is connected this should work. I've had success using a [Pogo Connect][pogo-stylus] and some [cheap styli][cheap-stylus] I picked up from Amazon.
</div>

### How does Blending work in other apps?

Apps that support FiftyThree's SDK (like Procreate) get some special abilities when connecting Pencil to them. In Procreate for example, your finger will activate the Smudge tool so you can freely switch between it and the Paint tool.

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="video connecting Pencil to Procreate and using Smudge">
  <figcaption>Quickly switch between painting and smudging with Pencil and Procreate.</figcaption>
</figure>

<div class="notice-info" markdown="1">
#### ProTip: Pencil's Eraser in Procreate
And just like with Paper, Pencil's eraser will you guessed it... erase in Procreate as well. The current Erase tool settings will be used whenever you flip Pencil on it's top to erase mistakes.
</div>

### Paper and Blend settings

In case you skimmed through the beginning part of this article where I covered Pencil's settings panel in Paper, here's the important part.

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="screenshot of Blend settings only">
  <figcaption>Draw/Blend/Nothing</figcaption>
</figure>

Usually Paper is good about distinguishing between the tip of Pencil and your finger to avoid unwanted blends. But if you have a lighter touch when drawing you might find that you trigger it more than you'd like. In this case I suggest flipping to the **Blend** option only when you need it.

### What's Blend good for?

When used in moderation smudging and blurring your drawings can take them to the next level. If you thought Surface Pressure was cool just wait till you see what's possible with Blend.

#### Depth of field and "bokeh" effects

When I first experimented with Pencil and blending, the first thing I did was smudge up the background of a portrait I drew of my wife. Previously I was using the watercolor brush to [dab blotches of white]({{ site.url}}{% post_url /mastering-paper/2014-10-25-erasing %}#paint-with-white-to-erase) to simulate a bokeh[^bokeh] effect.

[^bokeh]: In photography, bokeh is the aesthetic quality of the blur produced in the out-of-focus parts of an image produced by a lens. [Bokeh has been defined](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh "Wikipedia entry on bokeh") as "the way the lens renders out-of-focus points of light".

By rubbing your finger across the background in a circular motion you can quickly drop it out-of-focus. For the portrait below I move my finger quickly across the screen since the background shapes didn't need too much blending.

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="blending background of Wendy portrait">
  <figcaption>Experiment with the speed at which you move your finger. The slower the more intense the blur...</figcaption>
</figure>

As you blend the background pay careful attention not to cut in too far into the foreground object(s). It's this contrast between sharp and blurry that will ultimately help sell the effect by creating depth in the piece.

<div class="notice-info" markdown="1">
#### ProTip: Sketch Over a Blend
After blurring a background with the Blend tool go back over the edges of the objects still in focus. When drawing portraits I like to sketch whispy hair over a blurred background for a nice touch of realism.
</div>

##### More blurred backgrounds

Here's a few Paper portraits I used Pencil and Blend to draw. Sometimes it's fun to play with what's in focus as can be seen in the second drawing where I purposely smudged the figure's hand instead of the background.

<figure class="third">

  <figcaption>Check out all my <a href="{{ site.url }}/tag/bokeh/">"bokeh" PaperFaces portraits</a> where I used this effect with and without Pencil.</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Reflections

Create reflections (show mountain/water reflection sketch process)

#### Underwater and dreamy scenes

Underwater scene of girl with flowing hair and scuba diver dude.

#### Simulate fire and flames

#### Clouds, smoke, and fog

Improve on previous cloud making tutorial by blending and shaping them.

#### Simulate atmospheric perspective

Much easier to blurring/fading a landscape or background instead of being meticulous with your color choices (gray/blue further back you go).

#### Lighting effects

Glowing balls of light (solar and lens flares, the light around a lamp, etc.)

#### Outer space scenes

Outer space scenes (galaxies, star trails, etc). Link to **outer space tutorial** for detail examples and how to videos

### How to improve your blending

Now that you've seen what's possible by smudging and bluring with Pencil and Paper let me offer one bit of advice --- Don't overdo it! A little blend can go a long way and avoid turning your drawings into *amateur hour*.

Even if you don't purposely over blur a part of your drawing there's a few ways to recover.

#### Zoom

You'd think zooming in you might have greater control over the intensity of a smudge. I find that not to be true, and by not zooming in you actually can achieve much subtler blurs.

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="video of quick blending bursts">
  <figcaption>By barely touching the iPad's screen while you swipe it fast, you can create blends that aren't as harsh.</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Paint over a blend

A nice way to recover from over worked blends is by applying layers of watercolor on top. This helps roughen things up some and bring some texture downplaying the *airbrush* look. Some well placed pencil strokes or shades can also have the same effect. It really depends on the feeling you're going for.
