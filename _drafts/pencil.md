#### [FiftyThree Pencil Review](({{ site.url }}{% post_url mastering-paper/2014-11-28-pencil-53-review %}))
Apart from the addition of Surface Pressure, little has changed with Pencil since I [first paired it to Paper]({{ site.url }}{% post_url mastering-paper/2014-11-28-pencil-53-review %}) over a year ago. It still feels great to use, still has an insane battery life, still enables the blend tool, and still lets you rest your wrists on the screen without messing up your drawing.

## What makes Pencil so unique and special?

FiftyThree's Pencil is not like other styli and pens designed for Apple's iPad tablet. The unique shape and meticulous crafted finishes (Walnut, Graphite, and Gold) are the obvious differences, but I think it's the unseen qualities of the instrument that truly sets it apart.

For starters Pencil allows you to switch between tools in an intuitive and natural way when working with Paper and apps that support FiftyThree's SDK[^SDK]. Bounce between drawing, erasing, and blending without ever having to tap select a new tool --- the tip draws, the eraser erases, and your finger smudges.

[^SDK]: iOS apps that are compatible with Pencil by FiftyThree. [Procreate](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/procreate/id425073498?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4&at=1l3v9Qw&ct=sdk-procreate), [Noteshelf](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/noteshelf-notes-pdf/id392188745?mt=8&at=1l3v9Qw&ct=sdk-noteshelf), Squiggle, and [Astropad](http://astropad.com/).

</figure>

From day one Paper's tools have had a level of expressiveness I've yet to see matched in other iPad apps. Pencil augments them all with improved accuracy, finer controls over the strokes you make and erase, and palm rejection so you can rest your wrists on the screen.

### A different kind of tip

Pencil's wedge shaped tip is covered in a rubbery material like so many other iPad styli, but unlike these "dumb" capacitive relatives, Pencil's is much smarter. Using a combination of hardware + software wizardry, your strokes become more expressive depending on how you move, align, and touch the tip to the iPad's screen.

Thin lines are made with the tip's point with wider ones made with the full side of the tip. No other stylus I know of has this ability, making Pencil feel less like a digital tool and more like a real piece of charcoal or graphite (without the mess of course). Oh, and the [tip is user replaceable](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MM4KD4U/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00MM4KD4U&linkCode=as2&tag=mademist-20&linkId=SIDCNA73WKOEKRHM) too.

### A built-in eraser

What would a pencil be without an eraser? Well FiftyThree's Pencil has one of those too. When you want to erase something you just flip Pencil on its head and glide the rubbery top over the mistake.

Size can be controlled by making contact with the eraser's corner (for small mistakes) or the entire width to remove a larger area. Just like the tip the eraser is replaceable, though I've never had a need to replace mine yet.

<div class="notice-info" markdown="1">
#### Learn Erasing and Undoing Techniques
If you're looking for other erasing techniques that don't rely on Pencil's eraser you're in luck. I wrote an entire guide dedicated to [correcting and covering-up mistakes]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /mastering-paper/2014-10-25-erasing %}).
</div>

### Palm Rejection

I'm going to come right out and say it. Drawing, painting, and writing digitally on the iPad's glass surface feels really weird and isn't easy to do. Thankfully FiftyThree put a lot of engineering effort into Paper and Pencil to alleviate these issues --- specifically palm rejection.

When Pencil is connected to Paper (or supporting apps), **Palm Rejection** completely transforms the drawing experience. Just watching my frustrated daughters struggle to draw on an iPad without Pencil, it becomes painfully clear how awesome this feature is when enabled.

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="Everly and Chloe drawing with Pencil">
  <figcaption>The only problem now is dealing who's turn is it next to wield Pencil.</figcaption>
</figure>

Registering touches consistently is almost impossible for them at this age. Either their small fingers are ignored by the iPad or they're resting both hands on the screen effectively negating touches. Pencil solves both of these problems without fanfare --- it just works.

## Setting up Pencil

There's not to getting started with Pencil. Upon opening the box and removing the plastic wrap you'll want to pinch the tip and pull to charge the battery. In about 90 minutes you'll be good to connect it with Paper (or one the many supported apps) by pressing the tip to the pairing spot.

To view more details about your Pencil (battery level, firmware, serial number) tap the FiftyThree logo (or your profile icon when signed into Mix) in the upper right corner. 

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480">
  <figcaption>Screenshot of Pencil's settings in Paper app.</figcaption>
</figure>

<div class="notice-info" markdown="1">
#### Blend, Draw, Nothing Setting
You also have the option to toggle whether your finger **Blends**, **Draws**, or does **Nothing** when Pencil is connected to Paper. If you find Paper mistakenly smudging switching to Nothing mode is a great way to prevent that.
</div>

For even more information on how to setup your Pencil, change tips, or maintenance like updating the firmware I suggest you check our [FiftyThree's Support pages](http://support.fiftythree.com/customer/portal/topics/589142-pencil/articles). It's where I learned about this little fix after I noticed some erratic behavior in the app.

> If you have Multitasking Gestures or Accessibility Zoom enabled, this will prevent Pencil from operating effectively. Turn off Multitasking Gestures in your iPad Settings, under **General**. Turn off **Accessibility Zoom** under *General / Accessibility*.

## Surface Pressure, what's that?

When Pencil is connected to Paper it gains enhanced control and expressiveness over the tools and with a feature FiftyThree calls **Surface Pressure**. Stroke sizes are directly related to how much or how little of the tip's surface touches the screen. This applies to both the drawing end and eraser.

<div class="notice-warning" markdown="1">
#### Surface Area
Don't let **pressure** in the name fool you, it has very little affect over the marks you make. Pressing harder on the tip might have a slight effect due to the rubber deforming in shape, that's not really how Surface Pressure is meant to work.
</div>

Here's a cheat sheet I made showing how each of the tools respond to Surface Pressure.

<figure class="half">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="Surface Pressure cheat sheet">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="drawing with the tip, drawing with the edge">
  <figcaption>Marks made with and without zooming in to show the range of Surface Pressure enhanced tools. In most cases all of the tools can now make marks thinner/wider than possible without a connected Pencil stylus.</figcaption>
</figure>

If you ask me, the marriage of hardware and software that makes up Surface Pressure is Pencil's killer feature. It has completely transformed how I interact with Paper on my iPad by allowing me to be more free and loose. What does that mean exactly? Well let me show you...

### Pencil's design invites you to hold it differently

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="video showing alternate ways to hold Pencil">
  <figcaption>Surface Pressure let's you hold in alternate ways.</figcaption>
</figure>

I like to hold Pencil as if it's a piece of charcoal and utilize it's long edge when sketching. Not only does this change the quality of pencil strokes (I'll get to that in a minute), but it also causes you to use your entire arm instead of your wrist.

Sketching in this way is not only more fun but practicable. By using your entire arm you'll find that: 
  
  1. Drawing straight lines and ovals is much easier.
  2. You can create sensitive lines[^sensitive-lines] at will.
  3. Your drawings will have more movement and energy to them.
  4. It is quicker to fill in a large area.

[^sensitive-lines]: The shifting quality of weight, value, and texture of a line as related to a light source, spatial position, and weight or grounding of an object.

### A new tool for shading

You may have noticed in the cheat sheet above (or in your own experiments), that the sketch tool takes on new qualities with Surface Pressure. With this tool selected, the edge of Pencil's tip will make wide textured strokes that resembles those made with charcoal or graphite.

<figure class="half">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="wide sketch strokes with Pencil">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="strokes made with charoal and paper">
  <figcaption>Strokes made using the side of Pencil's tip compared against compressed charcoal and newsprint.</figcaption>
</figure>

Wide strokes made with the pencil tool overlap differently than the ink, marker, and brush tools. These "shade" strokes have a more defined edge can can cause color banding[^banding] in tones if not smoothed out. To better illustrate what I mean here's what I consider a tone with "blocky" strokes.

[^banding]: Abrupt changes between shades of the same color.

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="animation showing overlapping pencil strokes">
  <figcaption>With every overlapping pass the tones darken with noticeable edges of the stroke.</figcaption>
</figure>

<div class="notice-info" markdown="1">
#### ProTip: Shade in Circles
Reduce color banding by holding Pencil on its side and moving in a circular motion.
</div>

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="animation showing circular shading">
  <figcaption>Spread tones more evenly by overlapping them in a circular motion.</figcaption>
</figure>

If you look closely at the wide strokes of the pencil (sketch) tool, you'll notice it fades from dark to light.

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="closeup of Surface Pressure pencil stroke">
  <figcaption>Closeup of a pencil stroke. Dark edge is on the left and progressively gets lighter to the right.</figcaption>
</figure>

In my tests the placement it seems as if the placement of the darker edge is determined by the angle of your stroke. Dark points up and light points down. I've yet to find a way to reverse that, so it's worth keeping that fact in the back of your mind when making horizontal strokes.

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="show shade strokes and placement of dark and light">
  <figcaption>Dark points up, light points down.</figcaption>
</figure>

### What's Surface Pressure good for?

Now that you know what Surface Pressure is and roughly how it works. I thought it would be useful to show off what you can do with it.

#### Gesture drawing and other warm-ups

A great way to warm-up before doing any sort of serious drawing is with some quick gesture sketches. In art school we'd start each class capturing a model's movement with charcoal or conté crayons as they cycled through 2 minute poses.

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="charcoal on newsprint gesture drawings">
  <figcaption>Examples of gesture drawings in charcoal on newsprint paper.</figcaption>
</figure>

What's great about Pencil and Surface Pressure is you can pretty much get the same result as a stick of charcoal on newsprint paper. Even better is you're left with none of the mess on your fingers and hands.

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="Surface Pressure gesture drawings">
  <figcaption>Examples of gesture drawings in Paper with Pencil and Surface Pressure.</figcaption>
</figure>

To get the most out of this technique you're going to want to hold Pencil differently than you're accustomed to. Instead of using the one of the many [tripod grips](http://www.otplan.com/articles/pencil-grasp-patterns.aspx) you'll want to wrap your fingers around Pencil and rest your thumb just below the tip.

<figure class="half">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="traditional writing grip">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="palm grip">
  <figcaption>Comparison of grip types.</figcaption>
</figure>

As you sketch and draw with what I call the *palm grip* you'll need to get comfortable with both **pushing** and **pulling** your strokes. Your entire arm and wrist should be moving as you draw --- if you're only using just your wrist it won't be as effective. To better illustrate what I mean here's a slow-motion video of me drawing with the palm grip.

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="slow motion video of gesture drawing">
  <figcaption>Gesture drawing using Pencil held in the palm grip.</figcaption>
</figure>

Another great way to loosen up your arm and hand is to draw ovals over and over again. Focus on moving your entire wrist in loose circular motions and try to avoid stiff wrist movements. 

<figure class="half">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="animated GIF of circle drawing">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="shape drawing practice sheet">
  <figcaption>If you take a close look you'll notice I make several practice strokes in the air above the screen before making contact with the tip. This helps nail accurate and crisp lines without having to constantly erase or Rewind bad contours.</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Shading and tone building

Much of the same layering principles used when glazing with the watercolor brush can be applied to Surface Pressure armed pencil. If you're new to Paper and missed those techniques are need a brush up, I demonstrate them in [**Mastering Paper: Back to Basics**]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /mastering-paper/2014-02-09-basics %}#watercolor-brush-techniques).

Surface Pressure enabled shading does most of the hard work by automatically leaving marks that fade into the canvas. If you've had trouble painting smoothly with the watercolor brush or softening the edges, give the pencil tool a try --- it's way more forgiving.

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="zoomed in shading">
  <figcaption>Gesture drawing using Pencil held in the palm grip.</figcaption>
</figure>

Remember, each pass with the side of Pencil's tip leaves a noticeable stroke edge --- use this to your advantage! By being deliberate in the direction of your strokes you will help define and reinforce the form of an object. Sort of like [how hatching works]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /mastering-paper/2014-02-09-basics %}#ink-techniques), but with fatter strokes.

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="video of face shading with Pencil">
  <figcaption>By curving my strokes to match the dips around the nose it helps the form appear more three-dimensional.</figcaption>
</figure>

<div class="notice-info" markdown="1">
#### ProTip: Zoom In
For even more granularity over how fast a shade darkens, zoom in! You can get a few more levels of variation with each stroke to help make a more nuanced gradation.
</div>

#### Creating atmospheric effects

Creating atmospheric effects like fog, smoke, rays of light. Draw some sketches then write quick how-to.

## Blend, the Smudge Tool

As you might have guessed from the above heading, Blend lets you smudge stuff. Sadly this feature is only available to Paper when Pencil is connected, so you'll want to [pick one up](http://www.fiftythree.com/pencil "Buy Pencil by FiftyThree"). Trust me it's totally worth it!

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="finger blending stuff in Paper">
  <figcaption>Pushing pixels with your finger feels fantastic.</figcaption>
</figure>

### How does Blending work in Paper?

It's not a tool you select like the others, triggering it is way more intuitive than that. You simply use your finger to smudge whatever it is you want to blend or blur. And like most of Paper's tools it [reacts to the speed](http://making.fiftythree.com/the-precision-behind-blend/ "The Precision Behind Blend") at which you move.

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="video showing various types of blends">
  <figcaption>Speed matters. Fast strokes slightly blur objects while slow ones can be used to smudge and deform them.</figcaption>
</figure>

<div class="notice-info" markdown="1">
#### ProTip: Blending with a Non-Pencil Stylus
If you're looking for more control over your blends and smudges, try a capacitive stylus instead of your finger. As long as the tip of your stylus is big enough and Pencil is connected this should work. I've had success using a [Pogo Connect][pogo-stylus] and some [cheap styli][cheap-stylus] I picked up from Amazon.
</div>

<figure>

### How does Blending work in other apps?

Apps that support FiftyThree's SDK (like Procreate) get some special abilities when connecting Pencil to them. In Procreate for example, your finger will activate the Smudge tool so you can freely switch between it and the Paint tool.

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="video connecting Pencil to Procreate and using Smudge">
  <figcaption>Quickly switch between painting and smudging with Pencil and Procreate.</figcaption>
</figure>

<div class="notice-info" markdown="1">
#### ProTip: Pencil's Eraser in Procreate
And just like with Paper, Pencil's eraser will you guessed it... erase in Procreate as well. The current Erase tool settings will be used whenever you flip Pencil on it's top to erase mistakes.
</div>

### Paper and Blend settings

In case you skimmed through the beginning part of this article where I covered Pencil's settings panel in Paper, here's the important part.

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="screenshot of Blend settings only">
  <figcaption>Draw/Blend/Nothing</figcaption>
</figure>

Usually Paper is good about distinguishing between the tip of Pencil and your finger to avoid unwanted blends. But if you have a lighter touch when drawing you might find that you trigger it more than you'd like. In this case I suggest flipping to the **Blend** option only when you need it.

### What's Blend good for?

When used in moderation smudging and blurring your drawings can take them to the next level. If you thought Surface Pressure was cool just wait till you see what's possible with Blend.

#### Depth of field and "bokeh" effects

When I first experimented with Pencil and blending, the first thing I did was smudge up the background of a portrait I drew of my wife. Previously I was using the watercolor brush to [dab blotches of white]({{ site.url}}{% post_url /mastering-paper/2014-10-25-erasing %}#paint-with-white-to-erase) to simulate a bokeh[^bokeh] effect.

[^bokeh]: In photography, bokeh is the aesthetic quality of the blur produced in the out-of-focus parts of an image produced by a lens. [Bokeh has been defined](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh "Wikipedia entry on bokeh") as "the way the lens renders out-of-focus points of light".

By rubbing your finger across the background in a circular motion you can quickly drop it out-of-focus. For the portrait below I move my finger quickly across the screen since the background shapes didn't need too much blending.

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="blending background of Wendy portrait">
  <figcaption>Experiment with the speed at which you move your finger. The slower the more intense the blur...</figcaption>
</figure>

As you blend the background pay careful attention not to cut in too far into the foreground object(s). It's this contrast between sharp and blurry that will ultimately help sell the effect by creating depth in the piece.

<div class="notice-info" markdown="1">
#### ProTip: Sketch Over a Blend
After blurring a background with the Blend tool go back over the edges of the objects still in focus. When drawing portraits I like to sketch whispy hair over a blurred background for a nice touch of realism.
</div>

##### More blurred backgrounds

Here's a few Paper portraits I used Pencil and Blend to draw. Sometimes it's fun to play with what's in focus as can be seen in the second drawing where I purposely smudged the figure's hand instead of the background.

<figure class="third">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="Rene D portrait">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="hjalle portrait">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="Thomas D portrait">
  <figcaption>Check out all my <a href="{{ site.url }}/tag/bokeh/">"bokeh" PaperFaces portraits</a> where I used this effect with and without Pencil.</figcaption>
</figure>

This technique of blurring the background doesn't have to be used with just portraiture. In the following example it can be used to simulate macro photography, focusing on an object and throwing the rest out of focus.

The process is the same:

1. Start by roughly painting or drawing the background.
2. Evenly blend the objects you want to appear out-of-focus (in this case the entire background).
3. Draw the "in-focus" object leaving sharp edges and adding highlights and other details to make the illusion more convincing.

<figure class="half">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="plant blend step 1">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="plant blend step 2">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="plant blend step 3">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="plant blend step 4">
</figure>

#### Reflections

Ah reflections... they're so magical and easy to achieve with Blend. With a few minutes of quick drawing and a couple of swipes of your finger you can create photo realistic scenes just like these:

<figure class="half">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="first blend mountain">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="mountain scene sunset">
</figure>

To start you'll want to use the pencil tool to mark the horizon, and sketch out your scene --- I like to use a light gray color. Then start to [paint in the sky]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /mastering-paper/2013-09-05-drawing-clouds %}) and shape the mountains using the brush and fountain pen tools.

<figure class="third">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="sketching the horizon">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="painting the sky">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="drawing mountains">
</figure>

Clouds, trees, and any other details that reside in the top half of our composition are next. If you're looking for help on foliage and other greens be sure to check out my [**Mastering Paper: Drawing Trees and Grass** tutorial]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /mastering-paper/2013-08-31-drawing-trees %}).

<figure class="half">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="drawing trees">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="drawing more trees">
  <figcaption>Use the pen tools filled with a dark color to build up the tree silhouettes.</figcaption>
</figure>

Spend most of your effort perfecting the top half of the scene. Once you're happy with it we're going to create its mirror image. Select the fountain pen tool and roughly draw what you see up top down below --- but flipped upside down.

It doesn't have to be perfect, you just want to match the colors and general shape of each object. The most important ones being the trees.

<figure class="half">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="drawing reflections">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="even more reflections">
  <figcaption>You should end up with something similar to this.</figcaption>
</figure>

Now the funny part. Make sure Pencil is connected and Blend flipped on in Settings, and begin smudging from the horizon line down. At first move quickly to blur and gradually start to slow down as you pull trees into the water.

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="video showing how to create reflections">
  <figcaption>Depending on the chop of the water you may want to slightly zig-zag your smudges to distort the reflected mountain and trees.</figcaption>
</figure>

To finish things off select the pencil tool to sketch in waves, foam, and other details. Feel free to redraw any trees and shoreline you may have mistakenly blended when creating the water reflections.

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="detail shot of water waves">
  <figcaption>Need more pointers for drawing and painting water? I have you covered with my <a href="{{ site.url }}{% post_url /mastering-paper/2013-09-29-drawing-water %}"><strong>Mastering Paper: Drawing Water and Waves</strong> tutorial</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Underwater and dreamy scenes

The process above for creating reflections can also be used to paint beautiful underwater scenes.

<figure class="third">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="scuba blend">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="girl underwater">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="another scuba blend">
  <figcaption>Some examples of underwater scenes I painted with Paper by FiftyThree using Pencil and Blend.</figcaption>
</figure>

Similar to the reflections effect you'll want to determine what will be in and out of focus. In this case everything behind the scuba diver will be blurry so that's what we will paint first.

Using the watercolor brush you'll want to lay down a base color and then start layering objects on top of that. Feel free to use the pencil, ink pens, or marker tools to draw the rest of the background.

<figure class="third">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="scuba diver background step 1">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="scuba diver background step 2">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="scuba diver background step 3">
  <figcaption>Don't worry about placing too many details in at this point, we're going to smudge most of them away in a minute...</figcaption>
</figure>

With our background in good shape make sure Pencil is connected and Blend enabled and start smudging away. Using a circular motion softly move your finger tip over the background to blur it.

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="scuba diver blend background video">
  <figcaption>Working from top to bottom will help you cover the background with an even blend.</figcaption>
</figure>

When done correctly the water should look almost dreamlike with a uniform blur across the entire plane. To finish, add things like fish, a diver, or plant life to the scene. If you don't blend them they will automatically look as if they're floating adding a nice sense of depth to piece.

<figure class="half">

  <figcaption>By leaving the edges around the scuba diver sharp, the figure will pop-off the page as it contrasts against the soft background.</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Clouds, smoke, and fog

Building on the techniques found in my [**Mastering Paper: Drawing Clouds** tutorial]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /mastering-paper/2013-09-05-drawing-clouds %}), a few well placed smudges can greatly improve their realism. You can also modify the type of cloud more easily depending on how you smudge.

<figure class="half">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="dark fluffy clouds blended">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="dark streaky clouds smudged">
  <figcaption>Use quick blends for fluffy clouds and slow dragging smudges for for streaky ones.</figcaption>
</figure>

These techniques don't have to only be used to enhance clouds. They work great for softening pencil strokes, turning them into the beautiful *aurora borealis* (the Northern Lights).

<figure class="half">

#### Simulate atmospheric perspective

One way of adding depth to a landscape is by adhering to the properties of [atmospheric perspective](http://www.arthints.com/what-is-atmospheric-perspective/). Simply put --- far away objects appear more faded than those in the foreground.

Now you could be meticulous with your color choices and purposely mix gray and blue as you paint to get a similar effect. But if you're anything like me you're wouldn't mind a shortcut to speed things up.

In this drawing of tree tops the layers near the top are the most heavily blended. While the dark green trees at the bottom remain sharp and untouched.

  <figcaption>Blend the plane (or object) furthest from the foreground the most and gradually decrease that amount as you move forwards.</figcaption>
</figure>

Very similar to the reflection example above, you can create a dense layer of by blending everything --- not just the reflected trees. By smudging over the drawing it effectively lowers the contrast making things appear hazy.

Once blurred subtle details can be added back in. For example more defined edges in the tree tops or small waves in the water.

#### Lighting effects

Before Pencil and Blend were a thing you had to [get creative with white paint]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /mastering-paper/2014-02-09-basics %}#lightening-with-white) to make lens flares and other glowing orbs of light. With a few quick swipes of your finger you can easily transform plain shapes into lightsabers, auras, lightning, and more.

#### Outer space scenes

Galaxies far far away, stars, planets, black holes, and countless other celestial bodies can also benefit from blends and smudges. For in-depth instructions and videos be sure to check out my [**Mastering Paper: Drawing Outer Space**]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /mastering-paper/2015-01-02-drawing-outer-space %}) guide.

</figure>

The two sets of tutorials show how to smear color around a black canvas to create planets and glowing stars. And for those of you who don't own Pencil yet I walk you through how to create a similar scene with just your fingers.

#### Simulate fire and flames

By alternating between quick blends and slow smudges you can create some realistic looking flames and fire. It takes some practice to get the speed just right, but once mastered I think the end results speak for themselves.

### How to improve your blending

The temptation is really high to abuse the Blend feature in Paper --- especially after learning about all these awesome effects. It's easy to turn a drawing into a smeared mess resembling something you'd find on [**Photoshop Disasters**](http://www.psdisasters.com/) if don't know when to quit, a fact I learned the first time I tried to blend a face.

<figure>

  <figcaption>Blend got away from me here as I distorted the shape of the face too much and lost all of the texture from the original watercolor layers.</figcaption>
</figure>

Fear not, here's a few pointers to help keep your blends, blurs, and smudges in check.

#### Paint over a blend

A nice way to recover from over worked blends is by [applying layers of watercolor]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /mastering-paper/2014-02-09-basics %}#glazes "painting glazes with Paper") on top. This helps restore balance by upping the texture and downplaying the *airbrushed* look. Thoughtfully placed pencil strokes can also have the same effect with the right color selection.

#### Feather touches

Getting the intensity of a blur just right isn't always easy. To make a subtle blend you have to barely graze the iPad's screen as you quickly swipe against it. This works ok when you're covering a large area, but for small area blends it can be a real challenge.

#### Stronger Blending with Zoom
When opening the magnifying loupe to zoom-in the blurring effects intensifies which has its pros and cons. For subtle blurs I suggest Blending without a zoom.
