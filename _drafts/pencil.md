Not convinced you need FiftyThree's Pencil stylus in your life? Or maybe you just want to level-up your skills and learn some new techniques and ways of using it. This guide will familiarize you with Pencil, its features, and the steps necessary to reproduce effects exclusive to the device.

#### [FiftyThree Pencil Review](({{ site.url }}{% post_url mastering-paper/2014-11-28-pencil-53-review %}))
Apart from the addition of Surface Pressure, little has changed with Pencil since I [first paired it to Paper]({{ site.url }}{% post_url mastering-paper/2014-11-28-pencil-53-review %}) over a year ago. It still feels great to use, still has an insane battery life, still enables the blend tool, and still lets you rest your wrists on the screen without messing up your drawing.

## What makes Pencil so unique and special?

FiftyThree's Pencil is not like other styli and pens designed for Apple's iPad tablet. The unique shape and meticulous crafted finishes (Walnut, Graphite, and Gold) are the obvious differences, but I think it's the unseen qualities of the instrument that truly sets it apart.

For starters Pencil allows you to switch between tools in an intuitive and natural way when working with Paper and apps that support FiftyThree's SDK[^SDK]. Bounce between drawing, erasing, and blending without ever having to tap select a new tool --- the tip draws, the eraser erases, and your finger smudges.

[^SDK]: List iOS apps that work with Pencil.

From day one Paper's tools have had a level of expressiveness I've yet to see matched in other iPad apps. Pencil augments them all with improved accuracy, finer controls over the strokes you make and erase, and palm rejection so you can rest your wrists on the screen.

### A different kind of tip

Pencil's wedge shaped tip is covered in a rubbery material like so many other iPad styli, but unlike these "dumb" capacitive relatives, Pencil's is much smarter. Using a combination of hardware + software wizardry, your strokes become more expressive depending on how you move, align, and touch the tip to the iPad's screen.

Thin lines are made with the tip's point with wider ones made with the full side of the tip. No other stylus I know of has this ability, making Pencil feel less like a digital tool and more like a real piece of charcoal or graphite (without the mess of course). Oh, and the [tip is user replaceable](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MM4KD4U/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00MM4KD4U&linkCode=as2&tag=mademist-20&linkId=SIDCNA73WKOEKRHM) too.

### A built-in eraser

What would a pencil be without an eraser? Well FiftyThree's Pencil has one of those too. When you want to erase something you just flip Pencil on its head and glide the rubbery top over the mistake.

Size can be controlled by making contact with the eraser's corner (for small mistakes) or the entire width to remove a larger area. Just like the tip the eraser is replaceable, though I've never had a need to replace mine yet.

#### Learn Erasing and Undoing Techniques
If you're looking for other erasing techniques that don't rely on Pencil's eraser you're in luck. I wrote an entire guide dedicated to [correcting and covering-up mistakes]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /mastering-paper/2014-10-25-erasing %}).

## Setting up Pencil

There's not to getting started with Pencil. Upon opening the box and removing the plastic wrap you'll want to pinch the tip and pull to charge the battery. In about 90 minutes you'll be good to connect it with Paper (or one the many supported apps) by pressing the tip to the pairing spot.

To view more details about your Pencil (battery level, firmware, serial number) tap the FiftyThree logo (or your profile icon when signed into Mix) in the upper right corner.

#### Blend, Draw, Nothing Setting
You also have the option to toggle whether your finger **Blends**, **Draws**, or does **Nothing** when Pencil is connected to Paper. If you find Paper mistakenly smudging switching to Nothing mode is a great way to prevent that.

For even more information on how to setup your Pencil, change tips, or maintenance like updating the firmware I suggest you check our [FiftyThree's Support pages](http://support.fiftythree.com/customer/portal/topics/589142-pencil/articles). It's where I learned about this little fix after I noticed some erratic behavior in the app.

> If you have Multitasking Gestures or Accessibility Zoom enabled, this will prevent Pencil from operating effectively. Turn off Multitasking Gestures in your iPad Settings, under **General**. Turn off **Accessibility Zoom** under *General / Accessibility*.

## Pencil's Software Qualities

### Enhanced control and expressiveness over the tools and marks you make (Surface Pressure, eraser)

* What it is and why you should care about it
* Advantages to using
  * Allows for other ways of holding the styli because you can draw with the side of the tip (think sketching with a piece of charcoal)
  * Can cover a large area fast
  * Can make marks wider than normally possible
* How it affects each of the tools (comparison image or marks made normal/zoomed)
* Pencil tool gains the ability to "shade"
  * Overlapping doesn't work the same as a brush, is more "blocky"
  * Placement of hard edge appears to be controllable in certain situations
  * Discuss uses for the shading tool
    * Great for building up tones (similar to watercolor brush but even more gradual)
    * Gestural drawing (similar to sketching with charcoal). Flow from thin to thick lines with even more control than just varying the speed at which you draw. Feels more natural as a classically trained artist.
    * Creating atmospheric effects like fog, smoke, rays of light
    * Possible calligraphy/hand lettering applications for skilled individuals

## Blend, the Smudge Tool

* What it is and why you should care about it
* How Blend behaves in Paper
  * Speed and how it affects what you are smudging
* Pencil Settings
  * What you can learn about your Pencil by checking the settings and how to modify how your finger behaves (blend, draw, nothing)
  * Useful to deactivate Blend if you find yourself triggering it when not needed
* Blend effects and techniques. When used sparingly Blend can take your sketches to the next level.
  * Simulate "bokeh" effect found in photography to increase depth of field
  * Create reflections (show mountain/water reflection sketch process)
  * Underwater scene
  * Flames, fire, and candles
  * Smoke, clouds, and fog
  * Simulate atmospheric perspective (blurring/fading the further back you travel)
  * Glowing balls of light (solar and lens flares, the light around a lamp, etc.)
  * Outerspace scenes (galaxies, star trails, etc). Link to **Outerspace tutorial** for detail examples and how to videos
* Improving on your Blends
  * Overdoing the blur effect can kill a drawing fast and end up looking amateurish. Use watercolor washes on top of a smudge to give it more of a rough feel and lessen the over-airbrushed look.
