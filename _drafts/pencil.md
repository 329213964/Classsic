#### [FiftyThree Pencil Review](({{ site.url }}{% post_url mastering-paper/2014-11-28-pencil-53-review %}))
Apart from the addition of Surface Pressure, little has changed with Pencil since I [first paired it to Paper]({{ site.url }}{% post_url mastering-paper/2014-11-28-pencil-53-review %}) over a year ago. It still feels great to use, still has an insane battery life, still enables the blend tool, and still lets you rest your wrists on the screen without messing up your drawing.

## What makes Pencil so unique and special?

FiftyThree's Pencil is not like other styli and pens designed for Apple's iPad tablet. The unique shape and meticulous crafted finishes (Walnut, Graphite, and Gold) are the obvious differences, but I think it's the unseen qualities of the instrument that truly sets it apart.

For starters Pencil allows you to switch between tools in an intuitive and natural way when working with Paper and apps that support FiftyThree's SDK[^SDK]. Bounce between drawing, erasing, and blending without ever having to tap select a new tool --- the tip draws, the eraser erases, and your finger smudges.

[^SDK]: List iOS apps that work with Pencil.

From day one Paper's tools have had a level of expressiveness I've yet to see matched in other iPad apps. Pencil augments them all with improved accuracy, finer controls over the strokes you make and erase, and palm rejection so you can rest your wrists on the screen.

### A different kind of tip

Pencil's wedge shaped tip is covered in a rubbery material like so many other iPad styli, but unlike these "dumb" capacitive relatives, Pencil's is much smarter. Using a combination of hardware + software wizardry, your strokes become more expressive depending on how you move, align, and touch the tip to the iPad's screen.

Thin lines are made with the tip's point with wider ones made with the full side of the tip. No other stylus I know of has this ability, making Pencil feel less like a digital tool and more like a real piece of charcoal or graphite (without the mess of course). Oh, and the [tip is user replaceable](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MM4KD4U/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00MM4KD4U&linkCode=as2&tag=mademist-20&linkId=SIDCNA73WKOEKRHM) too.

### A built-in eraser

What would a pencil be without an eraser? Well FiftyThree's Pencil has one of those too. When you want to erase something you just flip Pencil on its head and glide the rubbery top over the mistake.

Size can be controlled by making contact with the eraser's corner (for small mistakes) or the entire width to remove a larger area. Just like the tip the eraser is replaceable, though I've never had a need to replace mine yet.

#### Learn Erasing and Undoing Techniques
If you're looking for other erasing techniques that don't rely on Pencil's eraser you're in luck. I wrote an entire guide dedicated to [correcting and covering-up mistakes]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /mastering-paper/2014-10-25-erasing %}).
</div>

## Setting up Pencil

There's not to getting started with Pencil. Upon opening the box and removing the plastic wrap you'll want to pinch the tip and pull to charge the battery. In about 90 minutes you'll be good to connect it with Paper (or one the many supported apps) by pressing the tip to the pairing spot.

To view more details about your Pencil (battery level, firmware, serial number) tap the FiftyThree logo (or your profile icon when signed into Mix) in the upper right corner.

</figure>

<div class="notice-info" markdown="1">
#### Blend, Draw, Nothing Setting
You also have the option to toggle whether your finger **Blends**, **Draws**, or does **Nothing** when Pencil is connected to Paper. If you find Paper mistakenly smudging switching to Nothing mode is a great way to prevent that.
</div>

For even more information on how to setup your Pencil, change tips, or maintenance like updating the firmware I suggest you check our [FiftyThree's Support pages](http://support.fiftythree.com/customer/portal/topics/589142-pencil/articles). It's where I learned about this little fix after I noticed some erratic behavior in the app.

> If you have Multitasking Gestures or Accessibility Zoom enabled, this will prevent Pencil from operating effectively. Turn off Multitasking Gestures in your iPad Settings, under **General**. Turn off **Accessibility Zoom** under *General / Accessibility*.

## Surface Pressure, what's that?

When Pencil is connected to Paper it gains enhanced control and expressiveness over the tools and with a feature FiftyThree calls **Surface Pressure**. Stroke sizes are directly related to how much or how little of the tip's surface touches the screen. This applies to both the drawing end and eraser.

<div class="notice-warning" markdown="1">
#### Surface Area
Don't let **pressure** in the name fool you, it has very little affect over the marks you make. Pressing harder on the tip might have a slight effect due to the rubber deforming in shape, that's not really how Surface Pressure is meant to work.
</div>

Here's a cheat sheet I made showing how each of the tools respond to Surface Pressure.

<figure class="half">

  <figcaption>Marks made with and without zooming in to show the range of Surface Pressure enhanced tools. In most cases all of the tools can now make marks thinner/wider than possible without a connected Pencil stylus.</figcaption>
</figure>

If you ask me, the marriage of hardware and software that makes up Surface Pressure is Pencil's killer feature. It has completely transformed how I interact with Paper on my iPad by allowing me to be more free and loose. What does that mean exactly? Well let me show you...

### Pencil's design invites you to hold it differently

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="video showing alternate ways to hold Pencil">
  <figcaption>Surface Pressure let's you hold in alternate ways.</figcaption>
</figure>

I like to hold Pencil as if it's a piece of charcoal and utilize it's long edge when sketching. Not only does this change the quality of pencil strokes (I'll get to that in a minute), but it also causes you to use your entire arm instead of your wrist.

Sketching in this way is not only more fun but practicable. By using your entire arm you'll find that: 
  
  1. Drawing straight lines and ovals is much easier.
  2. You can create sensitive lines[^sensitive-lines] at will.
  3. Your drawings will have more movement and energy to them.
  4. It is quicker to fill in a large area.

[^sensitive-lines]: The shifting quality of weight, value, and texture of a line as related to a light source, spatial position, and weight or grounding of an object.

### A new tool for shading

You may have noticed in the cheat sheet above (or in your own experiments), that the sketch tool takes on new qualities with Surface Pressure. With this tool selected, the edge of Pencil's tip will make wide textured strokes that resembles those made with charcoal or graphite.

<figure class="half">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="wide sketch strokes with Pencil">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="strokes made with charoal and paper">
  <figcaption>Strokes made using the side of Pencil's tip compared against compressed charcoal and newsprint.</figcaption>
</figure>

Wide strokes made with the pencil tool overlap differently than the ink, marker, and brush tools. These "shade" strokes have a more defined edge can can cause color banding[^banding] in tones if not smoothed out. To better illustrate what I mean here's what I consider a tone with "blocky" strokes.

[^banding]: Abrupt changes between shades of the same color.

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="animation showing overlapping pencil strokes">
  <figcaption>With every overlapping pass the tones darken with noticeable edges of the stroke.</figcaption>
</figure>

<div class="notice-info" markdown="1">
#### ProTip: Shade in Circles
Reduce color banding by holding Pencil on its side and moving in a circular motion.
</div>

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="animation showing circular shading">
  <figcaption>Spread tones more evenly by overlapping them in a circular motion.</figcaption>
</figure>

If you look closely at the wide strokes of the pencil (sketch) tool, you'll notice it fades from dark to light.

  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="closeup of Surface Pressure pencil stroke">
  <figcaption>Closeup of a pencil stroke. Dark edge is on the left and progressively gets lighter to the right.</figcaption>
</figure>

In my tests the placement it seems as if the placement of the darker edge is determined by the angle of your stroke. Dark points up and light points down. I've yet to find a way to reverse that, so it's worth keeping that fact in the back of your mind when making horizontal strokes.

### What's Surface Pressure good for?

Now that you know what Surface Pressure is and roughly how it works. I thought it would be useful to show off what you can do with it.

#### Gesture drawing and other warm-ups

A great way to warm-up before doing any sort of serious drawing is with some quick gesture sketches. In art school we'd start each class capturing a model's movement with charcoal or conté crayons as they cycled through 2 minute poses.

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="charcoal on newsprint gesture drawings">
  <figcaption>Examples of gesture drawings in charcoal on newsprint paper.</figcaption>
</figure>

What's great about Pencil and Surface Pressure is you can pretty much get the same result as a stick of charcoal on newsprint paper. Even better is you're left with none of the mess on your fingers and hands.

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="Surface Pressure gesture drawings">
  <figcaption>Examples of gesture drawings in Paper with Pencil and Surface Pressure.</figcaption>
</figure>

To get the most out of this technique you're going to want to hold Pencil differently than you're accustomed to. Instead of using the one of the many [tripod grips](http://www.otplan.com/articles/pencil-grasp-patterns.aspx) you'll want to wrap your fingers around Pencil and rest your thumb just below the tip.

<figure class="half">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="traditional writing grip">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="palm grip">
  <figcaption>Comparison of grip types.</figcaption>
</figure>

As you sketch and draw with what I call the *palm grip* you'll need to get comfortable with both **pushing** and **pulling** your strokes. Your entire arm and wrist should be moving as you draw --- if you're only using just your wrist it won't be as effective. To better illustrate what I mean here's a slow-motion video of me drawing with the palm grip.

<figure>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="slow motion video of gesture drawing">
  <figcaption>Gesture drawing using Pencil held in the palm grip.</figcaption>
</figure>

Another great way to loosen up your arm and hand is to draw ovals over and over again. Focus on moving your entire wrist in loose circular motions and try to avoid stiff wrist movements. 

<figure class="half">

  <img src="http://placehold.it/640x480" alt="shape drawing practice sheet">
  <figcaption>If you take a close look you'll notice I make several practice strokes in the air above the screen before making contact with the tip. This helps nail accurate and crisp lines without having to constantly erase or Rewind bad contours.</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Shading and tone building

Much of the same layering principles used when glazing with the watercolor brush can be applied to Surface Pressure armed pencil. If you're new to Paper and missed those techniques are need a brush up, I demonstrate them in [Mastering Paper: Back to Basics]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /mastering-paper/2014-02-09-basics %}#watercolor-brush-techniques).

Surface Pressure enabled shading does most of the hard work by automatically leaving marks that fade into the canvas. If you've had trouble painting smoothly with the watercolor brush or softening the edges, give the pencil tool a try --- it's way more forgiving.

<figure>

  <figcaption>Gesture drawing using Pencil held in the palm grip.</figcaption>
</figure>

Remember, each pass with the side of Pencil's tip leaves a noticeable stroke edge --- use this to your advantage! By being deliberate in the direction of your strokes you will help define and reinforce the form of an object. Sort of like [how hatching works]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /mastering-paper/2014-02-09-basics %}#ink-techniques), but with fatter strokes.

#### ProTip: Zoom In
For even more granularity over how fast a shade darkens, zoom in! You can get a few more levels of variation with each stroke to help make a more nuanced gradation.

#### Creating atmospheric effects

  * Creating atmospheric effects like fog, smoke, rays of light
  * Possible calligraphy/hand lettering applications for skilled individuals

## Blend, the Smudge Tool

* What it is and why you should care about it
* How Blend behaves in Paper
  * Speed and how it affects what you are smudging
* Pencil Settings
  * What you can learn about your Pencil by checking the settings and how to modify how your finger behaves (blend, draw, nothing)
  * Useful to deactivate Blend if you find yourself triggering it when not needed
* Blend effects and techniques. When used sparingly Blend can take your sketches to the next level.
  * Simulate "bokeh" effect found in photography to increase depth of field
  * Create reflections (show mountain/water reflection sketch process)
  * Underwater scene
  * Flames, fire, and candles
  * Smoke, clouds, and fog
  * Simulate atmospheric perspective (blurring/fading the further back you travel)
  * Glowing balls of light (solar and lens flares, the light around a lamp, etc.)
  * Outerspace scenes (galaxies, star trails, etc). Link to **Outerspace tutorial** for detail examples and how to videos
* Improving on your Blends
  * Overdoing the blur effect can kill a drawing fast and end up looking amateurish. Use watercolor washes on top of a smudge to give it more of a rough feel and lessen the over-airbrushed look.
