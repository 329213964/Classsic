Up until recently I would painstakingly erase and Blend away lines until I got them just right when drawing with Paper by FiftyThree.

When [version 2.2](http://news.fiftythree.com/post/104844221313/paper-update-2-2-holiday-bonus-edition-happy) was released this past December, along with it came a Color Picker and a way to fill in the background with any color you'd like. With a carefully mixed color and background fill I'm going to quickly teach you how to hack in a "faux" layer to help with sketching and tracing.

Have you noticed that the default page color in Paper by FiftyThree isn't a pure white? If you haven't here's a quick comparison between the two.

<figure>

</figure>

The key to the "faux" layer trick is to match your sketching color with exactly to the default background color. I've done the hard work for you and determined a close match by analyzing the color in Adobe Photoshop using the eyedropper tool and replicating it in Paper using the H/S/L sliders.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-default-background-mix.jpg" alt="default background color">
  <figcaption>Default background color mix: 48/2/96</figcaption>
</figure>

There's two ways of getting this color into your Paper palette:

1. Tap the small circle inside of the Color Mixer and adjust the 3 sliders to have the following values (48/2/96).
2. Open this drawing in Mix and use the [Color Picker]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /mastering-paper/2014-12-18-color-picker %}) eyedropper to sample the color. (Feel free to star the drawing for future reference)

Whichever way you end up choosing I suggest you drag this newly mix off-white color to an open slot in one of your palettes... for safe keeping.

</figure>

If you were to start drawing now it would look like you weren't drawing at all. To make it so these off-white lines show up we need to fill in the background with a contrasting color. In this example I went with a gray, but you can choose whatever color you want (we'll delete it later so don't agonize over the perfect color selection).

To fill in the background, simply drag a swatch from one of your palettes or the Color Mixer onto the canvas. When done correctly it should fill in the entire background leaving you with something like this:

  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-filled-gray-background.jpg" alt="dragging a color to the background">
  <figcaption>Quickly fill in the background by dragging a color onto the canvas and releasing.</figcaption>
</figure>

Now the fun begins! Select the off-white color you mixed/copied earlier and begin sketching. Since the off-white color isn't a 100% match it will stick out some when used with anything but the pencil tool, so stick with that for this rough sketching stage.

As you sketch don't worry about being messy or perfect with your strokes since they won't be part of the finished drawing. 

<< adding darker contours >>

Once you get the general idea and composition locked down you'll want to change the color to something darker. Depending on the background color you filled the canvas with you may need to adjust so these new strokes show up. Depending on your style of drawing you may want to switch tools too. I'm a pencil and watercolor man myself, but if you're drawing comics or diagrams the ink and marker tools would be a better choice.

<< tracing >>

Using the rough sketch as a guide trace over the white lines with a tool and color of your choice. You'll want to make sure it's darker than the off-white so it shows up, and may need to adjust the background color.

In this example I used a dark gray to draw the contour lines of the face and drop in some shadows using a cross-hatching technique. There's no need to complete the drawing at this point, you just want to establish enough contours and values to get you most of the way there. It can be disorientating to draw light on dark so take it as far as you're comfortable with.

<< clear page color option >>

Once you're happy with things this next step is to remove the rough sketch done in white. If you tap and hold on the Eraser tool for 2 seconds you'll be given the options to "Clear Ink" or "Clear Page Color." 

Tap Clear Page Color and watch as the background and rough sketch disappear leaving you with a prestine tracing.

<< removed background/rough sketch >>

Now you can continue adding to page by drawing and painting on top of what remains. I think you'll find this method is so much faster than having to carefully erase or Blend away an "underdrawing."

## Other Uses

Because I mostly do portrait work it never crossed my mind that this technique could be used to create grids and other templates.

I think Ron is onto something so I'm shamelessly building off of his idea by sharing a few templates on Mix. Feel free to download, save them to Paper, and remix your own.
